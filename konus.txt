Python for loop
Python is a powerful, general-purpose scripting language intended to be simple to understand and implement. It is free to access because it is open-source. This tutorial will teach us how to use Python for loops, one of the most basic looping instructions in Python programming.

Introduction to for Loop in Python
In Python, the for loop is often used to iterate over iterable objects such as lists, tuples, or strings. Traversal is the process of iterating across a series. If we have a section of code that we would like to repeat a certain number of times, we employ for loops. The for-loop is usually used on an iterable object such as a list or the in-built range function. The for statement in Python traverses through the elements of a series, running the block of code each time. The for statement is in opposition to the "while" loop, which is employed whenever a condition requires to be verified each repetition or when a piece of code is to be repeated indefinitely.
